    "## 1. How I Changed This Year\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the year, I tended to stay within my comfort zone by working only with my friends and classmates I already knew. While this felt easy and familiar, it wasn’t fair to others and limited my growth as a developer because strong collaboration skills come from diverse teamwork. Over this trimester, I’ve become more willing to branch out and collaborate with new people. I still want to continue improving by engaging with the entire class rather than a small group.\n",

    "## 2. 3 Key Things I Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sprint 1: This is where we set up our tools and did our first project/presentation with our group. My job was to teach others how to use the console. \n",
    "2. Sprint 2: This was probably my favorite project of the trimester. With our new groups we created a lesson with homework/hacks based on a certain topics. I liked it so much because we got to hear from our classmates and all their fun and creative ideas. I was in charge of presenting the 3.10 topic lists. \n",
    "3. Sprint 3: This was a really cool project where we got to present at N@TM and got a lot of feedback. My job for this project was sub module 3 which was our truth scanner game. Also I worked on and made sure all our backgrounds were working and made our page visually appealing for others. \n",

    "## 3. How N@TM Went\n",
    "\n",
    "N@TM went very well—many people who played our game genuinely enjoyed our submodules and gave us valuable feedback. Throughout the event, we encountered bugs that were difficult to find without a large number of testers trying out our portion of the project. I appreciated all the feedback because it will help us create a smoother, more polished experience for our next project.\n",

    "## 4. What Will the Next Project Look Like?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next project, I want to focus on building a more complete and immersive user experience. This includes designing with a stronger storyline, adding more intuitive interactions, and improving UI/UX to make the project look and feel more professional. I also want to improve how we plan our work by using better documentation, version control practices, and milestone-based development so that the project stays organized from start to finish.\n",

    "## 5. What Do I Want to Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to learn how to use APIs to make my projects more interactive and connected to real data. I want to understand how to read API documentation, make requests, and use the responses in my code. Gaining this skill will allow me to build more dynamic applications that go beyond basic features.\n",

    "When I took the test, I showed strong preformace in areas like program design and conditionals, however there are some areas that need work. I missed a lot of problems that I shouldn't have and made simple mistakes. This shouldn't happen and for the next time I will slow down and take my time with the questions that I am familiar with. Some of the questions I didn't know how to do, but I will learn more as the year progresses so I am not to worried. \n"
