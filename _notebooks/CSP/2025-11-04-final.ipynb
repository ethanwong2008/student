    "## How I Changed This Year\n",
    "\n",
    "In the begining of the year I was not communicating with my tablemates and was working on whatever was assigned to me and just got everything done by myself. Over the course of our first tri I slowley started to communicate with my group as I started to feel more comfortable. Although I can now communicate with my group much better I am still unable to communicate wth the class as a whole.\n",

    "## 3 Key Things\n",
    "\n",
    "Throught the tri I worked on many projects that all helped build my CS skills. I created a bell api that keeps track of out schools bell which is manualy put in but It can tell you when the next bell is and what class you are currently in. Next I made a HW project that would help other start learning basic API usage. And finally I worked on the main homescreen for the classes digital famine home screen.\n",

Throught N@TM we did enounter bugs that are difficult to find withought having lots of play tester play our section of the project. I loved all the great feedback we got as it can help me create a smoother experince for the next project we make.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Will The Next project Look Like?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next large project I take part in I would like to focus more on creating a smooth user expeince with little to no bugs allowing for anyone to easily test / use the project created. I would also focu on creating better communication for the groups taking place in the project for example due to slack being blocked on school wifi and due to many people not having it, I would create a discord server to better communicate as its very commenly used.\n",

    "The main group of questions that were missed were more vocabulary based as they contained words that I had no idea what they meant. I failed to notice some edge cases in some of the questions which should have been seen. The last questions the required multiple answers were almost all missed. I understand what I got wrong and how to fix them as they are either vocab or simple mistakes"
